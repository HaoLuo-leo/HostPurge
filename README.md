# Introduction

HostPurge is a versatile tool designed to remove host contamination from sequencing reads. It supports multiple modes of operation, allowing it to handle different levels of host contamination and precision requirements.

# Requirements

* Linux or macOS
* Python 3.8 or later
* KneadData 0.12.0 or later
* Kraken2 2.1.2 or later

# Installation

### Install from source

These instructions install the most up-to-date version of HostPurge:

```bash
conda install hostpurge

# usage

### Run HostPurge with the desired mode:

hostpurge input_1.fastq input_2.fastq output_dir --mode [a|b|c|d] [additional options]

### For detailed help information:

hostpurge --help

# Modes

HostPurge supports four modes, each suited for different contamination levels and precision needs:

Choosing the right mode
Mode a: Best for samples with low host contamination. This mode is slower but more thorough, making it ideal for sensitive samples where precision is critical.
Mode b: Fastest mode but with lower accuracy. Use this mode when you need quick results and the host contamination level is manageable.
Mode c: Recommended for samples with high host contamination. This mode balances speed and accuracy, providing reliable results for most scenarios.
Mode d: Best for samples with low host contamination but requiring high precision. This mode ensures the highest accuracy by using both KneadData and Kraken2 in sequence.

# Output files

HostPurge generates the following output files in the specified output directory:

cleaned_reads_1.fastq: Cleaned reads from input_1
cleaned_reads_2.fastq: Cleaned reads from input_2
host_contamination_report.txt: Report detailing the host contamination removal process
log.txt: Log file with detailed process information
